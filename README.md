Sudoku game app made with react native

## How to test

1.  **Make sure you have node and npm installed**
    You can check the version with the following commands

    ```sh
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    If you get an error with either commands, check out the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install them

1.  **Lauch the test app**

    First of all, make sure the needed packages are installed after you've cloned the repo

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    Then make sure Android and/ or Xcode are installed depending on which os you want to run the app. If they're not installed, make sure to follow the [react native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) (React Native CLI Quickstart tab).

    Once installed, run one of the following commands with the corresponding emulator opened or device plugged to the computer.

    ```sh
    react-native run-android
    react-native run-ios
    ```
