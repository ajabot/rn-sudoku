Sudoku game app made with react native

## How to test

1.  **Make sure you have node and npm installed**
    You can check the version with the following commands

    ```sh
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    If you get an error with either commands, check out the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install them

1.  **Lauch the test app**

    Thanks to Expo, you can try the app without installing it on your device.
    First of all, make sure the needed packages are installed after you've cloned the repo

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    Once everything is install you can launch Expo typing

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    You also need to have the Expo app installed on your device. Open the app and flash the QR code that appeared in your terminal or your browser after doing the `npm start`. And now enjoy the app.
